- Where do I see myself in 2 years. 
- I want to contribute as much as possible in making Lindera acheive its vision working with the team. 
However, once I have mastered the aspects of the role I would like to mentor and take up a challening roles as a tech lead and solve more technical challenges.

- What do I bring with me? 
- I bring the eagerness to learn and master. The above challenge took me about 6 hours with very little Node.js and express.js experience in the past. 
I had to unlearn and re-learn from the begining. 
The passion of creating something new for the world with Lindera and the experience of working with medical data and computer vision. 
The ease to understand and communicate the different verticals of Lindera. Owning to be an individual contributor. 

- How I can help scale the team? 
- Brainstorming and ideating open source projects that would keep myself as an enginner and motivate the team culture. 
- Creating a consistent process by helping others. 
Guarding the quality of the team through countinous code reviews and peer programming.
